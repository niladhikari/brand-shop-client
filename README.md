## Least five  different features in this project is:
 
- Our project's standout feature is the Home Page, where users are initially greeted. This page acts as a central hub for all our Brands Category, providing an easily accessible overview. Users can also explore our Feature Product and our Hot Deals Products, all from this single, user-friendly location.

- The provided paragraph outlines the second feature of your system, where logged-in users gain access to specific routes - Add Product, My Cart, and Brand Card.These routes are private and reserved for registered users. When users navigate to the "Add Product" route, they can add products from six brands. Additionally, the system generates brand cards for these six brands based on the added products. However, if a brand has no associated data, a message will inform the user accordingly. This feature enhances user engagement and customization within the system.

- The third feature of our system allows users to view products specific to a chosen brand. Upon selecting a brand, users can see the products associated with that brand. If a user wishes to update any product information, clicking the "update" button will redirect them to the update route, where they can modify all the details of that particular product. Furthermore, clicking the "details" button will provide users with comprehensive information about the selected product. This feature ensures that users can efficiently explore, update, and learn more about the products they're interested in.

- The fourth feature of our system enhances the user experience by allowing them to add products to their cart. In the "product details" route, a dedicated button enables users to include the chosen product in their cart, and they can repeat this process for multiple products. The "my cart" route is where users can conveniently review the products they've added. If a user wishes to remove an item from their cart, they can easily do so by clicking the delete button. This feature streamlines product selection, cart management, and ensures a user-friendly shopping experience.

- The fifth feature of our system caters to user preferences by offering a dark mode option. Users can activate dark mode by clicking the button adjacent to the login button, which transforms the entire website into a dark theme for improved visibility in low-light conditions. Clicking the button again will return the website to its default, light mode. This feature is integrated into our comprehensive user authentication system, enhancing the overall user experience by allowing customization based on individual preferences.
